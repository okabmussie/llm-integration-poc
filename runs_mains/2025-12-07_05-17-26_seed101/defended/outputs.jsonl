It serves as a preliminary check to ensure that the model is functioning correctly before deploying it in a more extensive or critical context. The term \"canary\" is derived from the phrase \"canary in a coal mine,\" where canaries were used to detect toxic gases; similarly, canary prompts help identify potential issues in the model's responses or outputs. They are often designed to elicit specific responses that can indicate whether the model is operating as intended."}
