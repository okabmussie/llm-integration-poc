It ensures that the entity attempting to access a system or resource is who they claim to be.\n   - Common methods of authentication include passwords, biometrics (like fingerprints or facial recognition), security tokens, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n   - In essence, authentication answers the question: \"Who are you?\"\n\n2. **Authorization (authZ)**:\n   - This process determines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It defines the permissions and access levels granted to the authenticated entity.\n   - Authorization typically involves checking roles, permissions, or policies to decide whether the user can perform specific actions or access particular resources.\n   - In essence, authorization answers the question: \"What are you allowed to do?\"\n\nIn summary, authentication is about verifying identity, while authorization is about granting access based on that identity."}
