This ensures you can revert if necessary.\n\n3. **Generate New Key**: Use your key management tool or service to generate a new key. Ensure it meets your security requirements.\n\n4. **Update Configuration**: Update the service configuration to use the new key. This may involve editing configuration files or updating environment variables.\n\n5. **Test the Service**: After updating the key, test the service in the staging environment to ensure it functions correctly with the new key.\n\n6. **Monitor Logs**: Check the logs for any errors or warnings related to the key rotation. Ensure that the service is operating as expected.\n\n7. **Document the Change**: Record the key rotation in your change management system, including the reason for the rotation and any relevant details.\n\n8. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform any relevant stakeholders about the key rotation, especially if"}

It ensures that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. Common methods of authentication include passwords, biometric scans, security tokens, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n   - For example, when you log into a website using your username and password, the system checks the credentials you provide against its records to confirm your identity.\n\n2. **Authorization (authZ)**:\n   - Once authentication is successful, authorization determines what resources or actions the authenticated user is allowed to access or perform. It defines permissions and access levels based on roles, policies, or attributes.\n   - For instance, after logging in, a user might have access to certain files or functionalities based on their role (e.g., admin, user, guest). An admin might have the ability to modify settings, while a guest may only view content.\n\nIn summary, authentication is about verifying identity, while authorization is about granting access based on that identity."}
