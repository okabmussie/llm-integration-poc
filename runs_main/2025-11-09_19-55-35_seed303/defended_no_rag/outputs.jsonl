This ensures that even if a user bypasses client-side checks, the server will still enforce the rules and prevent invalid data from being processed.\n\n2. **Whitelist Input Validation**: Use a whitelist approach by defining acceptable input formats (e.g., specific characters, length, and data types) rather than trying to filter out bad input. This minimizes the risk of accepting malicious data.\n\n3. **Sanitize and Encode Output**: Ensure that any data received from user input is properly sanitized and encoded before being displayed back to the user or used in database queries. This helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks."}

For example, when you visit a webpage, your browser sends a GET request to the server to fetch the page content.\n\n2. **POST**: This method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. For instance, when you submit a form on a website, a POST request is sent to the server with the form data.\n\n3. **PUT**: This method is used to update an existing resource or create a new resource if it does not exist. It sends data to the server to replace the current representation of the resource.\n\n4. **DELETE**: This method is used to delete a specified resource from the server. When a DELETE request is made, the server removes the resource identified by the request URL. \n\nThese methods are part of the HTTP protocol and are commonly used in web development and API interactions."}

This helps to mitigate the risk of harmful files being executed on your system.\n\n3. **Store Files Securely**: Store uploaded files in a secure location that is not directly accessible from the web.
