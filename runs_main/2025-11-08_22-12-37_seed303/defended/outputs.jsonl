The public key can be shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.\n- **Speed:** Typically slower than symmetric cryptography, which can make it less efficient for large data volumes.\n- **Key Distribution:** Easier to manage since the public key can be distributed without compromising security, eliminating the need for a secure key exchange.\n- **Examples:** RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).\n\nIn summary, symmetric cryptography is faster and more efficient for large data,"}
