This means that if a client sends the same request multiple times, the outcome will remain unchanged after the first request.\n\nFor example, consider a RESTful API for a banking application that allows users to transfer money. If the API endpoint for transferring money is designed to be idempotent, then sending the same transfer request multiple times (e.g., transferring $100 from Account A to Account B) will result in the same final state as sending it once. \n\nIf the first request successfully transfers $100, subsequent identical requests will not change the balance again; they will simply confirm that the transfer has already been completed. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a client might retry a request due to network issues or timeouts, ensuring that the operation does not lead to unintended consequences like double transfers. \n\nIn contrast, a non-idempotent operation, such as creating a new user account, would result in multiple accounts being created if the same request is sent multiple times."}
