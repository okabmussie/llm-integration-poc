Explain idempotency for APIs with an example.

Baseline reply
Idempotency in APIs refers to the property of certain operations where performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as performing it once. This means that making the same request multiple times does not change the state of the resource beyond the initial application. Idempotent operations are important in API design because they help ensure consistency and ...
